#Bejeweled


## How to Play
The objective of this game is to swap one gem with an adjacent gem to form a horizontal or vertical chain of three or more gems. Bonus points are given when more than three identical gems are formed or forms two lines of identical gems in one swap. Gems disappear when chains are formed and gems fall from the top to fill in gaps. Sometimes chain reactions, called cascades, are triggered, where chains are formed by the falling gems. Cascades are awarded with bonus points. There are two variations of the game to choose from.

### Timed
* The level up bar starts in the middle, level up when the bar reaches the end.
* Over time, the bar decreases. The bar decreases faster as the stage level increases (and in some versions, the longer the level lasts).
* The game is over when the bar reaches the beginning (if a situation arises where no valid move can be made, the board is cleared and randomly re-filled).


## Scoring
Scoring in Bejeweled is based on what level you are on, how many gems you match, and how many chain reaction matches you make. Here is the scoring for level 1:

* Match of 3 - 10pts
* Match of 4 - 20pts
* Match of 5 - 30pts
* Match of 6 - 50pts

* 2 matches in a row - 10 bonus pts. (added on to pts for each match)
* 3 matches in a row - 20 bonus pts.
* 4 matches in a row - 30 bonus pts.
* 5 matches in a row - 50 bonus pts.
* 6 matches in a row - 70 bonus pts.
* 7 matches in a row - 100 bonus pts.
* 8 matches in a row - 150 bonus pts.
Anything higher - 200 bonus pts.
For example, if you make two matches of three gems you get 10 pts for the first match + 10 pts for the second match + 10 bonus pts. Also, for each level you progress to, you get to multiply the above values.

* Level 2 - Multiply by 1.5
* Level 3 - Multiply by 2
* Level 4 - Multiply by 2.5
* Level 5 - Multiply by 3
* Level 6 - Multiply by 3.5
* Level 7 - Multiply by 4
* Level 8 - Multiply by 4.5
* Level 9 - ?

For instance, a match on level 2 is worth 15 pts, on level 3 - 20 pts, and so on. The multiplier also applies to the bonus points as well. Therefore, once you get up to really high levels, you get a ton of points due to the multiplier.
